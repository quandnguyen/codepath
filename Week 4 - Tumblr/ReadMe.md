## Tumblr

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to create custom navigation. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Tumblr.

Time spent: `<14>`

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- [x] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.

#### Optional

- [ ] Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
- [ ] Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
- [x] Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Loading screen appears for 2 seconds before Search feed appears 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Using array 
2. Using loop and calling items inside a loop 
3. Using viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear

### Video Walkthrough

## Notes

1. I didn't understand how to animate buttons the concept of viewWillAppear
2. Using loop was something new 

* Any libraries or borrowed content.
