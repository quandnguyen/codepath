# Week 1 Homework: Dropbox Prototype

This is a prototype for dropbox app. 

Time spent: roughly 12 hours spent on week 1 homework

Required steps completed: all
Optional steps completed: none. I would like to go back and do more optional steps but I need to submit the homework first. Would love to figure out how to do swipe interaction for the onboarding screens. 

Challenges: 
- Getting used to creating a new swift file for every screen that has code
- Understanding where to insert code in the swift file
- Figuring out what goes wrong by doing debugging 
- Sometime I couldn't find the bug and had to delete the viewController to start from scratch
